<nav>Ukraine: Ukrainian forces are regaining strategic terrain in areas to the north and northeast of Kharkiv, driving Russian troops from villages that were used to attack the city. Civilians from Mariupol and other Russian-occupied towns have been trickling into Ukrainian-controlled territory.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London, urged global businesses to withdraw from Russia and to stop "directly supporting that war machine."

Russia: Russians are beginning to confront the toll of the war, more than two months after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine.

Europe: The European Union proposed a ban on imports of Russian crude within six months, among other sanctions measures. More than 3,000 Finnish troops are taking part in military exercises with American, British, Estonian and Latvian soldiers, as Finland prepares to apply to join NATO.
